# AGM Drone Delivery Project

This project leverages Neo4j to model and optimize a drone delivery network. Using three key algorithms: community detection, degree centrality, and shortest path, we aim to improve delivery efficiency and routing for drones in the AGM system. The project includes the implementation of these algorithms in a Jupyter notebook, along with a presentation slide deck detailing the approach and findings.

## Project Components

- **Code Notebook**: The primary code implementation for all algorithms.
- **Presentation Slide Deck**: A summary of the project, its goals, and key findings.

## Datasets

The dataset used includes details on drone locations, delivery points, and associated metrics for optimal route planning.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Community Detection**: To identify clusters of delivery points that may have shared delivery routes.
2. **Degree Centrality**: Used to find the most important nodes in the graph, which can be useful for prioritizing routes.
3. **Shortest Path**: To compute the most efficient paths for drone deliveries.

## File Structure

- **[Drone Delivery Algorithm Notebook](path_to_notebook)**: Contains the code for all algorithms.
- **[Presentation Slide Deck](path_to_slide_deck)**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project.
